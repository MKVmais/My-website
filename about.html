    <p>I'm a computer technology student who loves cybersecurity, IT, and creative design. My journey started with curiosity for computers, and it's grown into a career path I'm building step by step. During my internship with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, I supported the Quality Assurance team in aligning internal applications with federal IT compliance standards, including Section 508 accessibility and DISA STIG security guidelines. This experience strengthened my understanding of secure system configuration, accessibility design, and government technology policy.</p>
